# Installation

### Order of Installation

For a typical StifleR implementation the order in which you should deploy and configure each component of the system is as follows:-

### **Enable and Configure your Microsoft P2P infrastructure**

A successful StifleR deployment relies on a correctly installed and configured Microsoft P2P infrastructure. This is beyond the scope of this document but, as usual, there’s a lot of useful information and links on the 2PintSoftware.com website to help in this regard.

### **Deploy 2Pint Microsoft P2P Reporting \(Optional\)**

2Pint _Microsoft P2P Reporting_ assists a StifleR implementation \(and administrators generally\) in many ways. Although optional, it is recommended, at least in the early stages of the project that you use this tool to give you visability of what is happening during your implementation and to check the health of your Microsoft P2P environment.

2Pint _Microsoft P2P Reporting_ will:

* Confirm and help to maximize P2P Caching effectiveness.
* Report on ‘Before and After’ stats

### **Install StifleR Server\(s\)**

* Deploy Rules for your environment
* Install StifleR on a server and configure dashboards

### **Deploy StifleR Clients**

* Install Client in Service mode
* Check configuration
* Enable debug logging if required
* Plan ongoing configuration

### **Configure Subnet Parameters**

* Configure Target Bandwidth
* Configure Subnet Description
* Configure Delivery Optimization
